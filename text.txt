Monologue on education
Education is one of the most important components of our world. Doctors, engineers and scientists exist because of education, so without it our new generation will have not have a future. 
Seems that the importance of education is obvious, but training systems are not identical in different countries. In Russia we have two variants of secondary education, 2 main higher education levels (bachelor degree and magistracy) and specialty as a heritage of soviet educational system. This scheme exists in all western countries, but every has itâ€™s own nuances. Abroad, schools make their own curriculum, adapting it for children and teachers. Also, students in foreign countries can choose their own subjects, which also increase adaptivity of educational system. Though, all post-soviet educational systems are similar witersburg Polytechnic University, because it is one of the top universities in IT sphere and it is located in Saint Petersburg city, the place, where I have always wanted to live and study.
To sum up, education is an important aspect of life that should not be underestimated. Take both general education and self-education seriously, and you will become better and life can seem less difficult for you.
